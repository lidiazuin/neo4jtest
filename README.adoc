# neo4jtest: Overwatch Heroes and Roles
Technical writer role @ Neo4J challenge - Lidia Zuin

== Description

Personal project to help with the categorisation of Overwatch characters according to their roles. The idea of this project is to classsify characters according to their roles, family relationships, country of origin, and species. For this project, the following resources were used:

- *Neo4j* for organising the data and presenting it graphically

- *Arrows.app* for presenting the graphic representation

== Creation of entries

*Nodes* are used to describe *entities* of a domain. Entities can be objects, people, or characters like in this case where the domain is the video game "Overwatch", which are: 

Ana +
Brigitte +
Hanzo +
Genji +
Pharah +
Reinhardt +
TorbjÃ¶rn +
Zarya +
Zenyatta 

*Properties* can be used to describe nodes. In this project, all properties are associated with characters:

- *Species:* Overwatch has characters that are human, animal, or omnic (robot)
- *Origin:* every character comes from a specific country, except when they are omnics

*Nodes* can have zero or more *labels*. They help with the classification of data. In this project, we are using two labels:

- *Character:* name of the character +
- *Role:* role of the character

*Relationships* express what is the connection between the nodes:

- *FAMILY_WITH:* used between characters to express they are members of a same family +
- *PLAYS_AS:* used between the character and their role, expressing how their gameplay is

== Associating entries

When an entry for a character is created, it is necessary to associate it with their role and properties. In some cases, characters can also be members of a same family (i.e. Pharah is family with Ana, who is her mother). All characters have the properties "species" and "origin" which can be also used for different kinds of clustering -- for example, both Hanzo and Genji come from Japan. 

This is an example of a Cypher query associating the character Hanzo, who plays as DPS as his role:

[source]
--
CREATE (c:Character{name:"Hanzo"})-[p:PLAYS_AS]->(r:Role{type:"DPS"}) RETURN c,p,r
--

To connect Hanzo with Genji as "family_with" since they are brother, it is important to differentiate the second "Character" with another variable (otherwise the system will read the query as a same character being family with themselves).

[source]
--
MATCH (c:Character{name:"Hanzo"})-[f:FAMILY_WITH]->(cc:Character{name:"Genji"}) RETURN c,f,cc
--
